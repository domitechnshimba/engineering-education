# How Collaboration Influences the Productivity of Developers

In one of our recent articles, we discussed how to implement **TEAM Work** in an organization or a group of like-minded people to make them more Productive and Innovative.

In this article, we are going to focus on the: **BENEFITS OF COLLABORATION/TEAMWORK.**

In case you don't know the meaning of the word **TEAM**, _it means **"Together, Everybody Achieves More".**_

This is why you need a Team for that your idea, your business or to get your organization working again. The general rule of thumb is, a good team accelerates the growth of an organization.Let's head straight to the benefits.

The Number one benefit every Developer enjoys when they work in a team and Collaborate with others is:

## 1. Productivity

**Productivity** might seem like a common word to you but it is more than just what you think, especially from the Developer side of things.

**Productivity** for a Developer means, the ability to solve more problems using Computer technology, an Increase in problem-solving speed and Delivery time of Solutions.

**_Collaborative working ensures an equal and fair distribution of work among team members to draw the best out of each of them in the Team._**

The skills and efficiencies of each member come to the fore and get forged with that of other members for a well-orchestrated performance.

Big Tech companies like **Facebook**, **Google**, **Apple**, etc, understand this very beneficial and that's why they make their offices very flexible for _Collaboration._

A basketball player from the US once said: **_"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins Championships"._**

Another benefit Team Work brings is the:

## 2. Opportunity for Creativity and Innovations

_The **collaboration** draws out **Creative**, **Innovative**, and **practical solutions** in the **Workplace**._

Instead of a single person trying to solve a problem, a brain-storming session with team members encourages participants to come out with out-of-the-box suggestions. This will throw open multiple methods of achieving the same goal, with the least effort.

The big plus is **INNOVATION**.

This generally helps the team to Develop solutions faster than a single person would have done.

## 3. Strong BondingWorking together bonds people better

_No man is an island; nor is desirable in a Workplace environment._

**Team Work** is the trick. **Collaboration** throws people together more often and in the process forge strong relationships among the Team members.

This will ensure the members are in a happy state of mind while at work, which is absolutely good for the organization/business and the Team behind it.

I think you've gotten the information I am trying to get across. I can't talk enough about **Teamwork**, it's something that generally helped me get to where I am.

The truth is, you need a Team for that your idea, your business/organization, and your growth as Developer.
